# copyleft-next #

copyleft-next is a new, post-post-modern, non-weak copyleft license
inspired by, though different from, the GNU GPL.

Contributions of patches, ideas, and criticism are welcome (see the file
CONTRIBUTING.md for more information).  In particular, the Copyleft-Next
Project actively seeks the participation of open source/free software
project developers who may not have considered helping with license
drafting before. License drafting is fundamentally about establishing
policies for projects, and therefore input from developers is typically
more valuable than input from lawyers.

Numbered releases of copyleft-next are stored in the Releases directory. A
draft of copyleft-next is maintained in the Drafts directory.

**The Copyleft-Next Project is *not* an effort endorsed by the Free
Software Foundation or the GNU Project. It is is also *not* an effort
associated in any way with the past or current employer of any participant.**
Contributors are expected and assumed to participate in their individual
capacity.
