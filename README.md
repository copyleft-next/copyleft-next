> "Exploring ideas for a modified copyleft license can't hurt."
    - Richard M. Stallman, July 2012

copyleft-next is a new, post-post-modern strong copyleft license inspired
by, though different from, the GNU GPL.

"Strong" refers to the Free Software Foundation's traditional and
influential characterization of the difference in copyleft scope between a
weak copyleft license (like the LGPL) and a strong copyleft license like
the GPL. "Strong" is not meant in any broader sense.

Contributions of patches, ideas, and criticism are welcome (see the file
CONTRIBTING.md for more information).  In particular, the Copyleft-Next 
Project actively seeks the participation of open source/free software
project developers who may not have considered helping with license
drafting before. License drafting is fundamentally about establishing
policies for projects, and therefore input from developers is typically
more valuable than input from lawyers.

Numbered releases of copyleft-next are stored in the Releases directory. A
draft of copyleft-next is maintained in the Drafts directory.

**The Copyleft-Next Project is *not* an effort endorsed by the Free
Software Foundation or the GNU Project. It is is also *not* an effort
associated in any way with the past or current employer of any participant.**
Contributors are expected and assumed to participate in their individual 
capacity.

All communications with journalists shall be handled by the Copyleft-Next
Marketing Committee, which does not exist yet and probably won't exist for
at least another year or three. For the avoidance of doubt, Simon Phipps
and Martin Michlmayr are not considered journalists.
