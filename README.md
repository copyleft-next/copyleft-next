GPL.next
========

GPL.next is a fork of the GNU General Public License, version
3. Contributions of patches, ideas, and criticism are welcome. Forks
in the GitHub sense are encouraged. The goal of this effort is to
develop an improved strong copyleft free software license.

**This is *not* an effort endorsed by the Free Software Foundation or
the GNU Project. This is also *not* an effort associated in any way
with Red Hat (the employer of one of the current participants) or any
other company.** Contributors are expected to participate in their
individual capacity.

The FSF has asserted copyright in the text of the GNU GPLv3. However,
the FSF has expressly authorized (though discouraged) modified
versions of the GNU GPL, subject to certain conditions:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ModifyGPL

Every effort shall be made to make this fork compatible with all
existing (and future) versions of the GNU GPL, which addresses one of
the FSF's concerns about modified versions of the GNU GPL.

The meta-license from the FSF stated in its FAQ shall be the license
of all versions of the GPL.next license text (to the extent that such
versions retain any copyrightable material from versions of the GNU
GPL in which the FSF has asserted copyright). Based on the FSF FAQ,
that meta-license may be stated as follows:

* Everyone has permission to use terms from any version of the GNU GPL
  (with or without modifications) in creating a new license text,
  without any restriction, other than these requirements: (1) the
  license must be "call[ed] ... by another name"; (2) no existing
  version of a GNU license Preamble may be included; and (3) if the
  instructions-for-use at the end of the GNU GPL are copied or
  adapted, they must be modified "enough to make it clearly different
  in wording and not mention GNU".

The name "GPL.next" is "another name" in the sense meant in this
meta-license. (It would be a violation of the meta-license to use the
"GNU" name, of course.) Contrary to what some believe, the "G" in
"GPL" does not stand for "GNU", but "General"; "GPL" means "license to
(or for) the general public". As such, the name "GPL" seems
generic. Indeed, the common use of "public license" in free software
license names without the word "general" probably represents a
historical failure to parse "GPL" correctly.

All copyrightable materials included in this project, other than any
copied or adapted portions of GNU license texts and except where
otherwise indicated, are dedicated to the public domain to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, pursuant to the Creative Commons
CC0 Universal Public Domain Dedication 1.0 (see the file CC0 for
