Harvey Birdman Rule
===================

A nontrivial number of interesting collaborative FLOSS legal endeavors
have been operated in a relatively nontransparent and methodologically
suboptimal manner. This project aims to be different, and this
therefore necessitates the following norms of participation, which
shall be known informally as the 'Harvey Birdman Rule':

  1. Contributions in the form of word-processing documents (even if
     in a free/open standard format), "redlined" or otherwise, are
     unacceptable and will be deleted immediately.

  2. No private mailing lists (including but not limited to those
     governed by the so-called Chatham House Rule) will be used by
     this project.  Public archiving of mailing lists used by this
     project is strongly encouraged; however, archives are not
     mandatory and partial archiving is permitted.

  3. Except in extraordinary cases, private telephone calls, private
     teleconferences and private in-person meetings shall not be used
     to discuss *substantive* development of this project.  Should
     such private communications nevertheless occur, participants in
     such communications are expected to publish summaries of any
     relevant discussions in a suitable public forum.

  4. Contributing by informal suggestions or proposals made in a
     posting to the project mailing list is welcome. However, any such
     suggestions or proposals that are made in the form of top-posted
     replies to quoted earlier mailing list postings by others are
     unacceptable and therefore shall be ignored.

  5. Criticisms of, or proposed changes to, the Harvey Birdman Rule
     are welcome, though such criticisms or proposals must themselves
     comply with the Harvey Birdman Rule as it exists at the time the
     criticism or proposal is made.
