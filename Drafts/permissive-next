THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                      permissive-next ("this License")

1. License Grants; No Trademark License

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Works.

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

2. Distribution: General Conditions

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform
   recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; and (ii)
   preserve all Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they
   remain pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license
   notices, license texts, and author attributions, but does not include
   logos, other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.

3. Licensing of Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You may license the Derived Work under
   terms of Your choice that are not inconsistent with this License. In
   particular, You have such permission as is necessary to license the
   entire Derived Work as a whole under the GPL.

4. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
   modification of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing
   terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
   the extent of Your copyright in the Patch.

5. Pass-Through

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
   a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

6. Termination

   Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You
   initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding declaratory
   judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims) alleging that any
   part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent.

   Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
   Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the rights
   of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to this
   License.

   To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary
   merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.

7. Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of permissive-next,
   designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions"). Unless
   I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works under Later
   Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later Version.

**    My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk   **
**    of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each       **
**    Distributor of My Work excludes the implied warranties of title,   **
**    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and              **
**    non-infringement.                                                  **

** 9. Limitation of Liability                                            **

**    To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any    **
**    Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages whatsoever **
**    whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or      **
**    consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort        **
**    (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor   **
**    knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.   **

10. Severability

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
