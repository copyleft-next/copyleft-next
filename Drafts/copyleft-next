THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                      copyleft-next ("this License")

0. Basic Definitions

   "I"/"Me" refers to the individual or legal entity that places My
   Code under this License.

   "You"/"Your" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising
   rights in My Code under this License. A legal entity includes each
   entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
   with such legal entity. "Control" means (a) the power to direct the
   actions of such legal entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
   (b) ownership of more than fifty percent of the outstanding shares
   or beneficial ownership of such legal entity.

   "Source Code Form" of Covered Code means the preferred form for
   making modifications to the Covered Code.

   "My Code" means the set of files in Source Code Form comprising the
   work of authorship that I license to You under this License,
   including any portion thereof.

   "Modified Code" means one or more files resulting from an addition
   to, deletion from, or other modification of the contents of one or
   more files in My Code, or (b) one or more new files containing
   portions of My Code.

   "Neighboring Code" means one or more files that specifically use
   functions or data declared or defined in My Code, but which are not
   Modified Code.

   "Covered Code" means a set of files consisting of My Code and/or
   Modified Code. Covered Code additionally includes all Neighboring
   Code that is Distributed with Covered Code, but Neighboring Code in
   isolation is not Covered Code.

1. Copyright and Patent License Grants

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform and publicly display My Code.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Code.

2. No Trademark License

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

3. Lawful Uses Unaffected

   This License does not exclude or limit any rights you have under
   copyright or other applicable law.

4. Distributing Covered Code

   a) General Conditions   

   If You Distribute Covered Code, You must (i) inform recipients how they
   can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the applicable
   conditions of sections 4 through 7; and (iii) preserve all Legal Notices
   contained in My Code (to the extent they remain pertinent). "Legal
   Notices" means copyright notices, license notices, license texts,
   warranty disclaimers, and author attributions, but does not include
   logos, other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.

   b) Pass-Through

   When You Distribute Covered Code, the recipient automatically receives
   a license to My Code from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

   c) Copyleft Condition for Distributing Modified Code

   If You Distribute Modified Code, You must conspicuously license
   such Modified Code under this License.

   d) Condition Against Imposition of More Restrictive Terms

   If You Distribute Covered Code, except as otherwise provided
   herein, You may not impose terms on the Covered Code that are more
   restrictive than the terms of this License. This condition is not
   excused merely because such additional terms result from Your
   compliance with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License
   (such as a court order or an agreement with a third party).

   e) Permission to Relicense Under Later Versions

   Unless I explicitly remove the option, You may additionally or
   alternatively Distribute Covered Code under a Later Version. 

   f) Permission for GPL Dual-Licensing

   You may additionally Distribute Covered Code under the GPL, so that a
   recipient may further Distribute such Covered Code under either this
   License (and/or a Later Version) and/or the GPL.

   [You may Distribute a Modification under this License even if it
   incorporates third-party material governed by a license that is both
   OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the release date of this License,
   provided that such other license does not itself prevent You from
   Distributing the Modification under this License. Compatibility of
   other third-party licenses must be measured against the requirement of
   the final paragraph of section 3 of this License. FIXME]

   g) Licensing of Aggregates

   If You Distribute Covered Code in an Aggregate, You may place the
   Aggregate under terms of Your choice, provided that such terms are
   consistent with the conditions of this License as to Covered Code
   contained in the Aggregate.

6. Conditions for Distributing Object Code Forms

   You may Distribute an Object Code Form of Covered Code, provided that
   you accompany the Object Code Form with a URL through which the
   Corresponding Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard
   or customary means of providing network access to source code.

   If you Distribute the Object Code Form in a physical product or tangible
   storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available
   through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent
   Distribution of the Object Code Form in the Product. However, if the
   Product itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source
   (made available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also
   comply with the first paragraph of this section.

   Each recipient of Covered Code from You is an intended third-party
   beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right
   to enforce its terms.

6. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
   modification of Covered Code (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing
   terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
   the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not
   negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.

7. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I offer to license, for a fee, Covered Code under terms other than
   a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
   License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the
   Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no
   longer subject to the conditions in sections 2 through 5.

8. Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 2 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen
   years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Code
   under this License.

10. Termination

    Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
       declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
       alleging that any part of My Code directly or indirectly infringes
       any patent.

    Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
    Code You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the
    rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
    this License.

    To the extent permission to make copies of Covered Code is necessary
    merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.

**     This disclaimer shall not be interpreted in such a way that       **

**     To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any   **
**     Distributor of My Code be liable to You for any damages           **
**     whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or     **
**     consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort       **
**     (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor  **
**     knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.  **

13. Severability

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
