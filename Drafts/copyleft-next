THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

                      copyleft-next ("this License")

1. License Grants

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform, and publicly display My Code.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Code. "Licensed Patents" means all
      patent claims licensable royalty-free by Me, now or in the future,
      that are necessarily infringed by making, using, or selling My Code,
      and excludes claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
      further modification of My Code.

2. Distributing Covered Code

   You may distribute Covered Code, subject to the following terms:

   a) Notice Requirements

      The Covered Code must preserve all pertinent Legal Notices contained
      in My Code and inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of this
      License. "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices,
      license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,
      other graphical images, trademarks, or trademark legends.

   b) No Further Restrictions

      You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of
      permissions granted under this License. This condition is not
      excused merely because such restrictions result from Your compliance
      with mandates or obligations extrinsic to this License (such as a
      court order or an agreement with a third party).

   c) Compatibility With Certain Licenses Does Not Constitute Further Restrictions

      Distribution of Covered Code incorporating material governed by a
      license listed in Appendix A does not impose further restrictions.
      This list is illustrative and not exhaustive. You have permission to
      ignore subsection 2.e) solely to the extent necessary to comply with
      such other license (or an equivalently or comparably permissive free
      software/open source license). But the requirement in subsection 2e
      to provide Corresponding Source is in no case limited by this
      permission.
      
   d) Export Control Laws

      Narrowly-tailored measures taken by You to comply with applicable
      export control laws do not impose further restrictions. An illustrative, but
      not exhaustive, example of a narrowly-tailored measure would be a notice
      that the Covered Code contains cryptographic software and should not be
      used or re-exported by a potential recipient before that potential
      recipient consults the laws and regulations of their country concerning
      cryptographic software.

   e) Derivative Works

      If You distribute a Derivative Work, You must license the Derivative
      Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
      licensing. This condition may not be circumvented through such means
      as separate distribution of portions of the Derivative Work. You may
      additionally license the Derivative Work under a version of the GNU
      General Public License published by the Free Software Foundation
      ("GPL"), so that the recipient may further distribute the Derivative
      Work under either this License or the GPL.

   f) Object Code

      If Covered Code is in Object Code form, You must accompany the Object
      Code with a URL through which the Ordinary Corresponding Source
      ("OCS") is made available, at no cost, by some standard or customary
      means of providing network access to source code. "Object Code" means
      any form of a work that is not Source Code.

      If you distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
      storage medium ("Product"), OCS must be available through such URL
      for two years from the date of Your most recent distribution of the
      Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product itself contains
      or is accompanied by OCS (readily accessible to the Product user),
      You need not also comply with the preceding paragraph.

      OCS means: (i) the Source Code form of the Covered Code; (ii) all
      scripts, instructions, know-how, and similar information that are
      reasonably necessary for a skilled developer to generate such Object
      Code from the Source Code provided under (i); and (iii) a list
      clearly identifying all Separate Works (other than those provided in
      compliance with (ii)) that were specifically used in building and (if
      applicable) installing the Covered Code (for example, a specified
      proprietary compiler including its version number). OCS must be
      machine-readable.

      Each recipient of Covered Code from You is an intended third-party
      beneficiary of this License solely as to this subsection 2.f), with the
      right to enforce its terms.

   g) Pass-Through

      When You distribute Covered Code, the recipient automatically
      receives a license to My Code from Me, subject to the terms of this
      License.

   Subsections 2.a) through 2.f) are conditions of this License.

3. Network Services Condition

   a) Permission and Definitions

   You may prepare a Derivative Work that is designed primarily to provide
   a Network Service, provided that that the Derivative Work informs
   Service Users how they may obtain the Network Service Source ("NSS"),
   at no cost, by some standard or customary means of providing network
   access to source code.

   "Network Service" means delivery of software functionality to third-
   party users in which distribution of most of the software does not
   occur, with users instead primarily accessing such functionality
   remotely, through network requests made by a client program, such as a
   web browser, to a server running the software.

   "Service Users" means: (i) for a Derivative Work that You distribute,
   all potential users of the Network Service provided by a recipient, and
   (ii) if You provide the Network Service, all actual users of the Network
   Service.

   NSS means: (i) the Source Code form of the Derivative Work; (ii) all
   scripts, instructions, know-how, and similar information that are
   reasonably necessary to use the Derivative Work to substantially
   replicate the Network Service, and (iii) a list clearly identifying all
   Separate Works that are specifically used in or required for providing
   the Network Service (for example, a specified web server including its
   version number).

   b) Opt Out Option

   If I explicitly state in My Work that I opt out of this condition, it
   shall not apply to You. You are not permitted to opt out unless I have
   opted out.

4. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I distribute Covered Code under a Proprietary License, then the
   licenses I grant You under section 1 are no longer subject to the
   conditions in sections 2 and 3. 

   "Proprietary License" means a license which (i) is not royalty-free, (ii)
   does not permit distribution, (iii) does not permit preparation of 
   derivative works, (iv) limits the number of licensed users or copies, 
   and/or (iv) contains field- of-use restrictions.

5. Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 2 and 3 no longer apply once fifteen years
   have elapsed from the date of My first distribution of My Code under
   this License.

6. No Trademark License

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

7. Termination

   Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

   a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
      such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

   b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
      counterclaims and cross-claims) alleging that all or part of My Code
      directly or indirectly infringes a patent.

   Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered Code
   You subsequently obtain.

   Termination of Your license grants does not terminate the licenses of
   those who have received copies of Covered Code from You.

   Licenses needed solely to run a copy of Covered Code shall never be
   terminated.

8. Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
   designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions").
   Unless I explicitly remove the option of distributing Covered Works
   under Later Versions, You may distribute Covered Code under any Later
   Version.

9. No Warranty

   Covered Code is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the
   risk of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
   distributor of Covered Code excludes the implied warranties of
   title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
   noninfringement.

10. Limitation of Liability

    To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any
    distributor of Covered Code be liable to You for any damages
    whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort
    (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the distributor knew
    or should have known about the possibility of such damages.

11. Severability

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

12. Definitions

    "Copyleft-Next Project" means the project that maintains the source
    code repository at <https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next/> as of the
    release date of this License.

    "Covered Code" means My Code or a Derivative Work.

    "Derivative Work" means a derivative work, collective work or
    compilation, or a work that contains all or part of My Code. But the
    following are not Derivative Works: (i) Mere Aggregation; (ii) a mere
    reproduction of My Code, without more; and (iii) if My Code fails to
    explicitly state an expectation otherwise, a work that merely makes
    reference to My Code.

    "I"/"Me"/"My" refers to the individual or legal entity that places My
    Work under this License. "You"/"Your" refers to the individual or legal
    entity exercising rights in My Code under this License. A legal entity
    includes each entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
    common control with such legal entity. "Control" means (a) the power to
    direct the actions of such legal entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent of the
    outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such legal entity.

    "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of Covered Code with a
    Separate Work.

    "My Code" means the particular work of authorship I license to You
    under this License.

    "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent of
    particular Covered Code and is not by its nature an extension or
    enhancement of the Covered Code, and/or a runtime library, standard
    library, or similar component that is used to generate an Object Code
    form of Covered Code..

    "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making
    modifications to it.
