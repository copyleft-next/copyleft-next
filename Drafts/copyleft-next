                      copyleft-next ("this License")

0. Basic Definitions

   "Covered Code" means a set of files consisting of My Code and/or
   Modified Code. Covered Code includes all Neighboring
   Code that is Distributed with Covered Code, but Neighboring Code in
   isolation is not Covered Code.

   "I"/"Me" refers to the individual or legal entity that places My
   Code under this License.

   "Modified Code" means one or more files resulting from an addition
   to, deletion from, or other modification of the contents of one or
   more files in My Code, or (b) one or more new files containing
   portions of My Code.

   "My Code" means the set of files in Source Code Form comprising the
   work of authorship that I license to You under this License,
   including any portion thereof.

   "Neighboring Code" means one or more files that specifically use
   functions or data declared or defined in My Code, but which are not
   Modified Code.

   "Source Code Form" of Covered Code means the preferred form for
   making modifications to the Covered Code.

   "You"/"Your" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising
   rights in My Code under this License.
   

1. Copyright and Patent License Grants

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform and publicly display My Code.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Code.

2. No Trademark License

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

3. Lawful Uses Unaffected

   This License does not exclude or limit any rights you have under
   copyright or other applicable law, including, but not limited to, fair use and 
   fair dealing rights.

4. General Conditions for Distributing Covered Code

   If You Distribute Covered Code, You must (i) inform recipients how they
   can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the applicable
   conditions of Sections 4 through 7; and (iii) preserve all Legal Notices
   contained in My Code. "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices, 
   license texts, warranty disclaimers, and author attributions, but does not 
   include logos, other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.

5. Distributing Covered Code: Copyleft Conditions and Pass-Through

   When You Distribute Covered Code, the recipient automatically receives
   a license to My Code from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

   If You Distribute Modifications, You must conspicuously license such
   Modifications under this License.

   In either case, You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise
   of rights in the Covered Code granted under this License. This condition
   is not excused merely because such restrictions result from Your
   compliance with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License
   (such as a court order or an agreement with a third party).

6. Copyleft Conditions: Exceptions and Limitations

   Unless I explicitly remove the option, You may additionally or
   alternatively Distribute Covered Code under a Later Version. In such a
   case, You may only Distribute Covered Code under This Version.

   Notwithstanding any other Section of this License, You may additionally 
   Distribute Covered Code under the GPL, so that a recipient may further 
   Distribute such Covered Code under either this License (and/or a Later 
   Version) and/or the GPL.

   You may Distribute a Modification under this License even if it
   incorporates third-party material governed by a license that is both
   OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the release date of this License,
   provided that such other license does not itself prevent You from
   Distributing the Modification under this License. Compatibility of
   other third-party licenses must be measured against the requirement of
   the final paragraph of Section 5 of this License.

   You may license an Aggregate under terms of Your choice, provided
   that such terms are consistent with the conditions of this License as
   to Covered Code contained in the Aggregate.

7. Conditions for Distributing Object Code Forms

   You may Distribute an Object Code Form of Covered Code, provided that
   you accompany the Object Code Form with a URL through which the
   Corresponding Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard
   or customary means of providing network access to source code.

   If you Distribute the Object Code Form in a physical product or tangible
   storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available
   through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent
   Distribution of the Object Code Form in the Product. 
   
   If the Product itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source
   (made available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also
   comply with the first two paragraphs of this section.

   Each recipient of Covered Code from You is an intended third-party
   beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right
   to enforce its terms.

8. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
   modification of Covered Code (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing
   terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
   the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not
   negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.

9. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I offer to license, for a fee, Covered Code under terms other than
   a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
   License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the
   Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no
   longer subject to the conditions in Sections 5 through 8.

10. Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in Sections 5 through  8no longer apply once fifteen
   years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Code
   under this License.

10. Termination

    Your license grants under Section 1 are automatically terminated if You

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
       declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
       alleging that any part of My Code directly or indirectly infringes
       any patent.

    Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
    Code You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the
    rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
    this License.

    To the extent permission to make copies of Covered Code is necessary
    merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.
