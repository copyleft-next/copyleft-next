THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE AS A LICENSE.

		      copyleft-next ("this License")

1. License Grants.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, We grant you:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable 
      copyright license, to make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and 
      publicly display Covered Works, in any medium.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable 
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, 
      offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer Covered Works. 

   This License does not exclude or limit any rights you have under 
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing or other
   equivalents.

2. No Trademark License.

   This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

3. Proprietary Relicensing. 

   If, more than one year after Our Distribution of the Received Work under 
   this License, We offer to license a work that would be a Covered Work 
   had you prepared it, under terms other than (i) a version of 
   copyleft-next, (ii) a license authorized under section 10, or (iii) a 
   license approved as 'Open Source' by the Open Source Initiative as of 1 
   January 2013, sections 4 through 9 of this License no longer apply to
   you.

4. Distribution: General Conditions.

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that you (i) inform 
   recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the 
   applicable conditions of sections 5 through 9; and (iii) preserve all 
   Legal Notices contained in the Received Work (in the case of a Derived 
   Work, to the extent such Legal Notices remain pertinent). "Legal 
   Notices" means copyright notices, license notices, license texts, and 
   author attributions, but does not include logos or other graphical 
   images.

5. Distributing Derived Works.

   If you Distribute a Derived Work, you must license the entire Derived
   Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
   licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
   separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

6. Pass-Through.

   When you Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
   from Us a license to the Received Work subject to the terms of this 
   License.

7. No Further Restrictions.

   You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the rights 
   granted under this License. This condition is not excused merely because 
   such restrictions result from your compliance with conditions or 
   obligations extrinsic to this License (for example, a court order or an 
   agreement with a third party). 

   Mere Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material licensed
   under the Apache License 2.0 does not impose further restrictions under 
   this section.

8. Distribution of Object Code in Products.

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work in a physical 
   product or tangible storage medium ("Product"), provided that you 
   accompany the Product with either: (i) a durable physical medium 
   customarily used for software interchange that contains the 
   Corresponding Source of the Covered Work, or (ii) notice of a network 
   location through which such Corresponding Source is available, at no 
   charge, for two years from the date of your Distribution of the 
   Covered Work in the Product. In either case, Corresponding Source must 
   be provided under this License. 

9. Network Distribution of Object Code.

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work from a network
   location, provided that you accompany the Object Code with clear 
   directions indicating how the Corresponding Source may be obtained under
   this License from a network location at no further charge and in a 
   reasonably equivalent manner.

10. Outbound (A)GPL Compatibility.

    You may Distribute a Covered Work under one or more of the following
    licenses published by the Free Software Foundation: (i) GNU General 
    Public License, version 2; (ii) GNU Affero General Public License, 
    version 3; (iii) later versions of the foregoing licenses.

11. Termination.

    Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if you

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless you cure 
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding 
       declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
       alleging that any part of the Received Work directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent.

    Termination of your rights disqualifies you from receiving new licenses 
    covering the Received Work, but it does not terminate the rights of 
    those who have received copies or rights from you subject to this 
    License.

    To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary 
    for running it, such permission is not terminable.

12. Later License Versions.

    The Copyleft-Next Project <https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next/> may 
    publish new versions of copyleft-next, designated by a distinguishing 
    version number ("Later Versions"). Unless We explicitly remove the 
    option of Distributing Covered Works under Later Versions, you may 
    Distribute Covered Works under any Later Version.

15. Severability.

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License 
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of 
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

16. Definitions.

    "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work in Object Code form means (i)
    the Source Code form of the Covered Work; (ii) all additional Source 
    Code files, scripts, instructions and similar information that are 
    reasonably necessary for a skilled developer to generate the Covered 
    Work from the Source Code provided under (i); and (iii) a list clearly 
    identifying all Separate Works (other than those provided in compliance 
    with (ii)) that were actually used in building and installing the 
    Covered Work. Corresponding Source must be machine-readable.

    "Covered Work" means the Received Work or a Derived Work.

    "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
    adapts, is based on, contains, transforms or translates all or part of
    the Received Work such that copyright permission is required. Derived
    Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere making of a verbatim
    copy of the Received Work.

    "Distribute" means to transfer or make available a copy to someone else
    (in the case of an organization, to someone outside of the 
    organization), such that copyright permission is required.

    "Distributor" means Us and anyone else who Distributes a Covered Work.

    "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable by Us, now or in 
    the future, that are necessarily infringed by making, using, or selling 
    the Received Work, and excludes claims that would be infringed only as 
    a consequence of further modification of the Received Work.

    "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a 
    Separate Work. However, if the license of such an aggregation restricts 
    users from exercising rights in the Covered Work given by this License, 
    the aggregation is not Mere Aggregation.

    "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

    "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship We license to 
    you under this License.

    "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent of a
    particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension or
    enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library, standard
    library or similar component bundled with a Separate Work that is used 
    to generate an Object Code form of the Covered Work.

    "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making 
    modifications to it.

    "We"/"Us"/"Our" refers to the individual or organization that places 
    the Received Work under this License.
