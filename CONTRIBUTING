Harvey Birdman Rule
===================

A nontrivial number of interesting collaborative FLOSS legal endeavors
have been operated in a relatively nontransparent and methodologically
suboptimal manner. This project aims to be different, and this
therefore necessitates the following norms of participation, which
shall be known informally as the 'Harvey Birdman Rule':

  * Contributions in the form of word-processing documents (even if in
    a free/open standard format), "redlined" or otherwise, are
    unacceptable and will be deleted immediately.

  * No private mailing lists (including but not limited to those
    governed by the so-called Chatham House Rule) will be used by this
    project. Archives of mailing lists used by this project shall be
    public.

  * Except in extraordinary cases, private telephone calls, private
    teleconferences and private in-person meetings shall not be used
    to discuss *substantive* development of this project.  Should such
    private communications nevertheless occur, participants in such
    communications are expected to publish summaries of any relevant
    discussions in a suitable public forum.

  * Contributing by informal suggestions or proposals made in a
    posting to the project mailing list is welcome. However, any such
    suggestions or proposals that are made in the form of top-posted
    replies to quoted earlier mailing list postings by others are
    unacceptable and therefore shall be ignored.

  * Criticisms of, or proposed changes to, the Harvey Birdman Rule are
    welcome, though such criticisms or proposals must themselves
    comply with the Harvey Birdman Rule as it exists at the time the
    criticism or proposal is made.
