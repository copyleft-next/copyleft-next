                   copyleft-next 0.1.0 ("this License")
                         Release date: 2013-01-26                         

1. License Grants.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, We grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable 
      copyright license, to make, copy, Distribute, publicly perform and 
      publicly display Covered Works, in any medium.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable 
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, 
      offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer Covered Works. 

   This License does not exclude or limit any rights You have under 
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing or other
   equivalents.

2. No Trademark License.

   This License does not grant any rights in Our name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

3. Effect of Proprietary Relicensing. 

   If, more than one year after Our first Distribution of the Received Work 
   under this License, We offer to license a work that would be a Covered 
   Work had You prepared it, under terms other than (i) a version of 
   copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next Project, (ii) a license 
   authorized under section 10, or (iii) a license approved by the Open 
   Source Initiative as of 1 January 2013, sections 4 through 9 of this 
   License no longer apply to You.

4. Distribution: General Conditions.

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform 
   recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the 
   applicable conditions of sections 5 through 9; and (iii) preserve all 
   Legal Notices contained in the Received Work (to the extent they remain 
   pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices, 
   license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos or 
   other graphical images.

5. Distributing Derived Works.

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived
   Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
   licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
   separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

6. Pass-Through.

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
   from Us a license to the Received Work subject to the terms of this 
   License.

7. No Further Restrictions.

   When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further 
   restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under 
   this License. This condition is not excused merely because such 
   restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations 
   extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a 
   third party). Mere Distribution of a Covered Work incorporating material 
   licensed under the Apache License 2.0 does not impose further 
   restrictions under this section.

8. Distribution of Object Code in Products.

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work in a physical 
   product or tangible storage medium ("Product"), provided that You 
   accompany the Product with either: (i) a durable physical medium 
   customarily used for software interchange that contains the 
   Corresponding Source of the Covered Work, or (ii) notice of a network 
   location through which such Corresponding Source is available, at no 
   charge, for two years from the date of Your most recent Distribution of 
   the Covered Work in the Product. In either case, Corresponding Source 
   must be provided under this License. 

9. Network Distribution of Object Code.

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work through a 
   computer network, provided that You accompany the Object Code with clear 
   directions indicating how the Corresponding Source may be obtained under
   this License from a network location at no charge and in a reasonably 
   equivalent manner.

10. Outbound (A)GPL Compatibility.

    You may Distribute a Covered Work under one or more of the following
    licenses published by the Free Software Foundation: (i) GNU General 
    Public License, version 2; (ii) GNU Affero General Public License, 
    version 3; (iii) later versions of the foregoing licenses.

11. Termination.

    Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure 
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding 
       declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
       alleging that any part of the Received Work directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent.

    Termination of Your rights disqualifies You from receiving new licenses 
    covering the Received Work, but it does not terminate the rights of 
    those who have received copies or rights from You subject to this 
    License.

    To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary 
    merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.

12. Later License Versions.

    The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next, 
    designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions"). 
    Unless We explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works 
    under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later 
    Version.

15. Severability.

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License 
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of 
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

16. Definitions.

    "Copyleft-Next Project" means the project that maintains the source 
    code repository at <https://gitorious.org/copyleft-next/> as of the 
    release date of this License.

    "Corresponding Source" of a Covered Work in Object Code form means (i)
    the Source Code form of the Covered Work; (ii) all scripts, 
    instructions and similar information that are reasonably necessary for 
    a skilled developer to generate the Covered Work from the Source Code 
    provided under (i); and (iii) a list clearly identifying all Separate 
    Works (other than those provided in compliance with (ii)) that were 
    specifically used in building and installing the Covered Work (for 
    example, a specified proprietary compiler including its version 
    number). Corresponding Source must be machine-readable.

    "Covered Work" means the Received Work or a Derived Work.

    "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
    adapts, is based on, contains, transforms or translates all or part of
    the Received Work. Derived
    Works do not include Mere Aggregation or the mere making of a verbatim
    copy of the Received Work.

    "Distribute" means to distribute, transfer or make available a copy of a Covered Work to 
    someone else.

    "Distributor" means Us and anyone else who Distributes a Covered Work.

    "Licensed Patents" means all patent claims licensable by Us, now or in 
    the future, that are necessarily infringed by making, using, or selling 
    the Received Work, and excludes claims that would be infringed only as 
    a consequence of further modification of the Received Work.

    "Mere Aggregation" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a 
    Separate Work.

    "Object Code" means any form of a work that is not Source Code.

    "Received Work" means the particular work of authorship We license to 
    You under this License.

    "Separate Work" means a work that is separate from and independent of a
    particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension or
    enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library, standard
    library or similar component that is used to generate an Object Code 
    form of a Covered Work.

    "Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making 
    modifications to it.

    "We"/"Us"/"Our" refers to the individual or legal entity that places 
    the Received Work under this License.

    "You"/"Your" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising rights 
    in the Received Work under this License. For legal entities, “You” 
    includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common 
    control with You. “Control” means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to 
    cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract 
    or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent of the 
    outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.
